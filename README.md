# Personal Expense Tracker

This work provides a data-driven solution to track, analyze, and forecast monthly expenses. Designed from a studentâ€™s perspective, it includes data generation, expense categorization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and Excel dashboard all done in Python/Excel.

## Project Highlights

- [**Data Generation**](./in_python/Data_Creation.ipynb): Created a realistic dataset in Python, reflecting real-life student expenses.
- [**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](./in_python/Complete_Data_Lifecycle.ipynb): Analyzed spending patterns, categorized expenses, and identified savings opportunities.
- [**Predictive Modeling**](./in_python/Complete_Data_Lifecycle.ipynb): Built a forecast model for monthly expenses using SARIMA.
- **Income Analysis**: Summarizes monthly and annual income to identify trends.
- **Expense Breakdown**: Categorizes utility expenses for a detailed view of spending.
- [**Interactive Dashboard**](./Dashboard%20excel/income_and_utilities_expense_tracker.xlsx): Uses charts and graphs to visualize income and expenses dynamically.
